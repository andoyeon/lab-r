# R Markdown
## R Markdown
### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

요약

```{r cars, echo =FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE,error = TRUE, warning=TRUE, comment=NA}
plot(pressure)
hist(cars$speed)
boxplot(cars$dist)
```

The mean spped of cars was `r mean(cars$speed)`.

#THE END

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
